Main method is at : TicTacToe.java 
server init: java TicTacToe 9999
clinet init: java TicTacToe localHost 9999

Current Problem :
    1. Host always goes first. 
    2. after clicking resetGame button, the match has bugs in asserting winner. 
    3. resetScore when used if it is client's turn will show bugs asserting scores.
